# Engine Package Initialization (`__init__.py`)

## File Overview

This is the initialization file for the `srlane.engine` package. It serves as the entry point for the engine module, which contains the core training and optimization infrastructure for the SRLane lane detection model.

## Purpose in SRLane System

The `__init__.py` file marks the `engine` directory as a Python package, allowing other modules to import components from this package. The engine package contains:

- **Runner**: Main training/validation orchestrator
- **Optimizer**: Optimizer factory for building PyTorch optimizers
- **Scheduler**: Learning rate scheduler factory
- **Registry**: Component registration system for trainers and evaluators

## Code Structure

The file is currently minimal (1 line), containing only basic package initialization. This is a common pattern in Python packages where the initialization file serves primarily as a package marker.

## Usage in SRLane

When other modules import from the engine package, Python automatically executes this `__init__.py` file. For example:

```python
from srlane.engine.runner import Runner
from srlane.engine.optimizer import build_optimizer
```

## Role in Project Architecture

The engine package is a foundational component that:

1. **Abstracts Training Logic**: Provides high-level training orchestration through the Runner class
2. **Manages Optimization**: Handles optimizer and scheduler configuration
3. **Enables Component Registration**: Provides registry system for extensible trainer/evaluator components
4. **Integrates with Lightning**: Uses PyTorch Lightning Fabric for distributed training capabilities

The package follows the factory pattern, where configuration dictionaries are used to build concrete implementations of optimizers, schedulers, and other training components.
